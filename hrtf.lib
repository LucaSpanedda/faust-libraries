//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay_and_phase_delay
//In physics, and in particular in optics, the term group delay has the following meanings:
//The rate of change of the total phase shift with respect to angular frequency,

tph(d,rad,f) = -(d*rad/2*ma.PI*f);

//through a device or transmission medium, where \phi \  is the total phase shift in radians, and
// \omega \  is the angular frequency in radians per unit time, equal to 2Ï€f
// 2\pi f\ , where f \  is the frequency (hertz if group delay is measured in seconds).
